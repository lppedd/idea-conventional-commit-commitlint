# Commitlint Conventional Commit

Looking for the latest **plugin binaries**? Get them [here][1] as `.zip`  
<small>Supported IDE versions: `192.*` to `201.*` (both inclusive)</small> 

-----

This plugin extends the functionality of [Conventional Commit][2] to provide commit
types and scopes via Commitlint rules. The only requisite is to have a `.commitlintrc.json` file 
in the project's root directory.

The considered rules are **type-enum** and **scope-enum**.
